# Vue talk

Whenever at a talk, after hearing something discussed my most first 
question is: "So how do I use it?" Sadly, often there is no answer. After 
hearing great things about this or that technology, now I have to go back to some 
other resource to figure out how exactly to get it to work.

So insted of doing this to you, I have provided slides talking about concepts 
and programs showing how the concepts are used. Both kinds of information are made
available here. 

The examples are set up one to a directory labeled prog##. 
To complete
this freedom, you should also get a copy of the site vuejs.org from github and 
install it on your machine. Now you can go to your favorite space and 
enjoy learning.

To run this: 
- Clone this repository
- run `npm install` to get all the required modules

Now you are ready to run the examples. 
- In a browser navigate to the file prog##/index.html

I suggest using Chrome browser as it is excellent for debugging or
steppping through the code.

Enjoy.

To view the slide deck locally, in another window navigate to 
`reveal.js/vuejs.html`. Either use the arrows on the right bottom of each slide
or the right and left arrow keys on your keyboard to move through the slides.
